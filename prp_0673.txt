# DHRUV PATEL 0673

I HAVE NEITHER GIVEN NOR RECEIVED UNAUTHORIZED AID IN COMPLETING THIS PROJECT.

Name: Dhruv Patel (last four: 0673)
Python version used: 3.12.1

How to run (examples):
  python pgrk_0673.py 10 -1 samplegraph_0673.txt
  python pgrk_0673.py 0  -1 samplegraph_0673.txt
  python pgrk_0673.py -3 -2 samplegraph_0673.txt
  python pgrk_0673.py 0  -1 biggraph_0673.txt    # 100-node performance test

Arguments:
  iterations   >0  : run exactly that many iterations
              =0  : run until convergence with default error rate 1e-5
              <0  : run until convergence with error rate 10^(iterations)
  initialvalue  0  : all zeros
                1  : all ones
               -1  : 1/N
               -2  : 1/sqrt(N)

Notes:
  • Implements Google’s PageRank algorithm using synchronous updates.
  • Damping factor (d) = 0.85.
  • Includes “scaling step” each iteration to normalize rank vector (L1 = 1).
  • Handles dangling nodes by redistributing their rank uniformly.
  • Prints seven-decimal precision exactly as required.
  • For N ≤ 10 → prints all iterations with Base and Iter lines.
  • For N > 10 → prints only the final iteration vector.

Performance verification:
  Successfully executed PageRank on a 100-node, 500-edge random graph.
  Converged in 10 iterations within ~3 seconds on Windows 11 (Python 3.12.1).
  Sum of final ranks verified to be approximately 1.0000000.

Testing summary:
  • Verified outputs match the example PageRank convergence pattern.
  • No external libraries used — fully compatible with Linux AFS environment.
  • Meets runtime requirement (<5 seconds for N ≤ 100).
